# Gulp Build

This is my current build process using gulp for all the mini projects I work on. Includes basic scaffolding.

# Usage

1. Edit package.json and replace `PACKAGE_NAME` in the name, repository.url, bugs.url, and homepage fields
2. Open up your terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `gulp`
